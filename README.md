# MAP MazeMap Demo

This Node-RED flow illustrates the potential of combining NTT Managed Automation Platform (MAP) and Cisco MazeMap for geolocation usecases.

Description: 

* GPS data is taken from the Microsoft Geolife Dataset 
* NTT MAP (Node-RED) is used to serve the the web landing page with the MazeMap as well as the GPS coordinates of 3 arbitrary tracked objects
* Frontend (jquery) polls location data from Node-RED and updates the position of the markers in the MazeMap

## Use Case Description

Want to represent near-real-time gps locations in outdoor and indoor MazeMaps? This demo will show you how easy it is to build a feasible prototype. Now go on and substitute "X" with whatever you want(satellites, ships, people, dogs)We put the technology, the advantage is yours!

## Installation and usage
* [Install NodeRed](https://nodered.org/docs/getting-started/local)
* Import MAP-MazeMap-demo-flow.json
* Click deploy
* Browse http://{{your-node-RED-path}}/demo
* Near-Real-Time location data corresponding to three different indidivuals of the Geolife Dataset will be simulated on the demo

## NTT Managed Automation Platform (MAP) is:
### A tool we use internally
MAP was developed for our Technical and Manage Services teams to automate their work, meanwhile used worldwide internally.
### A tool we use for our clients
We improve our processes to better manage client requests and to have better results by using MAP internally.
### A tool our clients use
We offer the same tool to our clients to automate their work for them, to co-create with them or just use what was already developed.
### It's not just a tool, itâ€™s a journey
Automation is a journey, we have internal methodology Automation by Design, that covers whole automation lifecycle from finding automations, via the company and processes improvements, working agile to the MAP tool.
